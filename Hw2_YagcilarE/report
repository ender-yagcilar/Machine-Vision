EE576 - Project 2
Ender Yağcılar

In this project the main objective was combining images by using homography maps. In Part A, ı solved homography map given in the question by using cv::solve method(A * q = a).4 points from each image is requested because 4 points was needed in part B to calculate homography map. 3 is needed for Part A.  
In part B, i solved for homography map by using cv::findHomography method of opencv
In part C, i combined images by using homography maps. This is applied N2 times. At each time, new image is formed by using consequent image.

    MY COMMENT ON N1 AND N2:
    As N1 increases, cv::findHomography can find more accurate homography maps.
    As N2 increases, deviation increases significantly and images become meaningless.
